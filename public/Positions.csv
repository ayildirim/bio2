ElektroPAN,Software Engineer,"Elektropan is a company making industrial monitoring devices (electrical compensation, power consumption e.g.) to help companies manage their current drawal from the central power station. This helps factories avoid getting penalty fee which is very high.  These monitoring devices has GSM/GPRS module which enables internet connection. I was the sole software engineer at that time working as a full-stack developer. I developed a server backend to listen and log incoming data from these devices. It was a Multi-threaded TCPIP server using C# and .NET. It was capable of handling clients up to 1000 in actual tests. I developed a web panel to allow customers to login and see their monitored data through time. I developed a real-time sms alert system. This system uses a proprietary GSM modem which allowed me to send sms alerts through serial connection directly to the server machine. Customers were able to receive real-time alert messages in cases of high power/current drawal.",,Sep 2011,Dec 2011
