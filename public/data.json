      "description": "Design & Development of an Agricultural Drone capable of autonomous flight and spraying farms with payload up to 3kgs. This was my final thesis project at Sakarya University. I wrote a thesis on quadcopter control dynamics and advantages and disadvantages of different multicopter designs. Project was later combined with a research project within our department. We received very good funding from the University. We managed to build 2 hexacopters capable of carrying payload of 1-1,5 kgs. I also developed 1 quadcopter that is capable of carrying 0.5kgs. Hexacopters used Naza flight control system which provided very stable flight controls and allowed us to better focus on use case development of vehicle. Quadcopter used an opensource flight controller, Ardupilot. It was harder to setup but allowed me to experiment with its dynamics at a lower level and learn more about dynamics of flight controller software."

      "description": "Elektropan is a company making industrial monitoring devices (electrical compensation, power consumption e.g.) to help companies manage their current drawal from the central power station. This helps factories avoid getting penalty fee which is very high. These monitoring devices has GSM/GPRS module which enables internet connection. I was the sole software engineer at that time working as a full-stack developer. I developed a server backend to listen and log incoming data from these devices. It was a Multi-threaded TCPIP server using C# and .NET. It was capable of handling clients up to 1000 in actual tests. I developed a web panel to allow customers to login and see their monitored data through time. I developed a real-time sms alert system. This system uses a proprietary GSM modem which allowed me to send sms alerts through serial connection directly to the server machine. Customers were able to receive real-time alert messages in cases of high power/current drawal."
